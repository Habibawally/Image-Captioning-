# 🖼️ Image Captioning using CNN + LSTM

## 📌 Overview
This project generates meaningful captions for images using a deep learning model that combines **Computer Vision (CNN)** and **Natural Language Processing (LSTM)**. The system understands the content of an image and describes it in natural language.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal
Automatically generate accurate and descriptive captions for images.

### ✅ Real-World Applications:
- Assisting visually impaired individuals to understand images.
- Automatically tagging and organizing image datasets.
- Powering AI systems like search engines, recommendation systems, and social media auto-captions.

## 🧠 Model Architecture

### 🔹 1. Encoder (Feature Extraction)
- Uses a **pre-trained CNN** (InceptionV3 / VGG16 / ResNet).
- Extracts visual features from images.
- Classification layers are removed to output a **feature vector**.

### 🔹 2. Decoder (Caption Generation)
- Built using **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**.
- Inputs to the decoder:
  - Extracted image features.
  - Previous words in the caption.
- Predicts the **next word** until the `<end>` token is reached.

### 🔹 3. Word Embedding
- Text is tokenized and padded.
- Each word is converted into a numerical vector via an **Embedding Layer**.


## 📁 Dataset & Preprocessing
You can use datasets such as:
- **Flickr8k, Flickr30k, MS COCO**

### Preprocessing Steps:
✔ Clean captions: lowercase, remove punctuation, etc.  
✔ Add `<start>` and `<end>` tokens to each caption.  
✔ Tokenize and pad sequences.  
✔ Extract image features using the pre-trained CNN encoder.
